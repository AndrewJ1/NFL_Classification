# NFL_Classification_Project
**Machine Learning with NFL Data**

In this project I will build and interpret a classification model based on NFL data. 

#### Data
The dataset is sourced from a Kaggle Competition - The NFL Big Data Bowl
https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020/data

#### Objective
The Kaggle competition, was to build a model to predict how many yards a team will gain on given rushing plays. However, as my project is to build a classification model, I will first create a feature to determine whether a play was successful or not, and use that as the basis for my classification model.
